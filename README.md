# container
C++ implementation of containers vector, stack and map (with an RBTree).

## Description
The goal of this project is to learn about containers from the STD libraries.

I had to :
  - Reproduce the behavior of each container by making my own in a custom namespace (namespaceft, in this case)
    * So std::vector<int> needs to be interchangeable with my ft::vector<int>.
  - Read, read, read, read and read documentation;
  - Understand thoroughly how templates work;
  - Test and Benchmark the containers. Mine are about 1.5 to 3 times slower then the originals. 20 times slower was instant failure.
 
Overall, this project took me 2-3 months of work and a lot of headaches.

## Thoughts
I was a extremely tiresome project... If was to redo it, I would :
 - Check the source code (because I didn't);
 - Figure out a good way to keep track of what's left to do (I tried to organize myself, but nothing really worked for me);
 - Ask others about the difficulties they faced and what I should be careful of.
